# CalculatorPlus

CalculatorPlus is a Python application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations and calculate the square root of numbers. This project is simple, beginner-friendly, and efficient.

# Features

1) Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2) Calculate the square root of numbers.
3) Handles division by zero with appropriate error messages.

# Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository

git clone <repository_url>

cd git_assignment_HeroVired

2. Run the Application
  
python calculator.py

3. Customize & Test

   Modify the main block in the code to test various features.

4. Example Usage

   calculator = Calculator()

# Arithmetic operations

num1 = 16

num2 = 4

print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {calculator.add(num1, num2)}")

print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {calculator.subtract(num1, num2)}")

print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {calculator.multiply(num1, num2)}")

print(f"{num1} / {num2} = {calculator.divide(num1, num2)}")

# Square root calculation

num3 = 25

print(f"The square root of {num3} = {calculator.square_root(num3)}")

5. Sample Output:

16 + 4 = 20

16 - 4 = 12

16 * 4 = 64

16 / 4 = 4.0

The square root of 25 = 5.0

Releases:

Version 1.0.0

- Basic arithmetic operations added.

Version 2.0.0
